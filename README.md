# PongSpr2024
My contribution to the open source project I did with classmates in my Spring 2024 Open Source Software Practicum class. The group as a whole made a "pycade" application with tetris, hangman, and pong. This uploaded portion showcases my work, pong.py, but the whole group project is linked [here](https://github.com/RudyTaba1/PyCade)

Features:
  - Terminal record of score & in app score
  - Computer AI that progressively gets more difficult
  - Disco mode (press C)
