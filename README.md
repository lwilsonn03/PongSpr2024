# PongSpr2024
My contribution to the open source project I did with classmates in my Spring 2024 Open Source Software Practicum class. The group as a whole made a "pycade" application with tetris, hangman, and pong. Since I don't have the permission of my former classmates to publically upload their parts, this is entirely my work. 

Features:
  - Terminal record of score & in app score
  - Computer AI that progressively gets more difficult
  - Disco mode (press C)
